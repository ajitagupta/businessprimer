# A Business Primer

Succinctly, a business can be defined as a repeatable process that
1. creates or provides something of value
2. that people want or need
3. at a price they are willing to pay, 
4. in a way that satisfies the consumer's needs and expectations and
5. provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.
