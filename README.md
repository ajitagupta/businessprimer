# A Business Primer

Succinctly, a business can be defined as a repeatable process that
1. creates or provides something of value
2. that people want or need
3. at a price they are willing to pay, 
4. in a way that satisfies the consumer's needs and expectations and
5. provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.

Every business is a collection of 5 processes each of which integrates smoothly with its next: Value Creation, Marketing, Sales, Value Delivery, Finance. These five are the building blocks of every idea and business plan, thus clearly defining them is crucial to understanding how the business works. We shall explore them step-by-step in greater detail.

## 1. Value Creation
Every business is limited by the size and quality of the market it aims at serving. If you don't have a large set of people who really want what you can offer, your chances of establishing a viable business are very slim (so-called *Iron Law of the Market*). Discover what people need or want and build it. However, not every business is economically valuable. Any skill or knowledge that helps create value, market, sell, deliver value, or manage finances is economically valuable. In total there are twelve standard forms of economic value:
* Product: Price a tanglible item at higher than its production costn (e.g. books)
* Service: Charge a fee for the benefit of help (e.g. barbershop)
* Shared Resource: Charge for access (e.g. gym, fitness clubs)
* Subscription: Charge a recurring fee (e.g. cable, satellite television)
* Resale: Resale an asset of the purchased bulk directly from a wholesaler to a retail buyer at higher price (e.g. Walmart, Barnes & Noble)
* Lease: Charge for the usage of an asset for a predefined amount of time (e.g. cars, boats, houses, DVD's)
* Agency: Charge a percentage of the transaction price for selling an asset on behalf of a third-party (e.g. literary agents, real estate)
* Audience Aggregation: Charge access fee for connecting an audience to a business (e.g. magazines with ad sites)
* Loan: Charge for lending money with an additional interest rate (e.g. mortgage, auto loans, credit cards)
* Option: Charge fee for taking action (e.g. movie or concert ticket, coupons, licensing rights)
* Insurance: Charge fee for taking on risk (e.g. car or health insurance, warranty cover for consumer goods)
* Capital: Collect a portion of the profit of ownership of a business (e.g. angel investing, venture capital, purchasing stock in publicly traded companies)

That said, all values are not treated equally. The value depends on the eye of the perceiver. In general, if you are looking for a business idea start looking for hassles. Where there is a hassle that is eliminable and has an attractive and easy-to-visualize end result there is a lucrative opportunity. Moreover, packaging individual forms together or unbundling them allows to customize value for different types of customers and give them exactly what they want without creating anything new (e.g. mobile phone with monthly service plan, songs in a music album).

At the outset of creation lies the prototype, the first attempt at creating something useful. Prototypes, or Minimum Viable Offers, give you a first understanding of your product and its value in the market. In each further iteration it should be clearly and quickly defined what one aims to achieve, thereby making best use of the obtained feedback. Virtually every improvement you make to an offer can be thought of in terms of nine economic values: either improving convenience (quick, reliable, easy, flexible, cost) or fidelity (efficacy, status, aesthetic appeal, emotional impact), both is rare. Thus, a choice must be made (so-called *trade-off*). To predict accurately this choice one can sell the offering (description, prototype, a few renderings) before it actually exists (example: FitBit), so-called *Shadow Testing*. If the idea is promising you're in a great position to make it happen! If not, you're able to cut your losses without losing money or reputation.
