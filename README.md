# A Business Primer

Succinctly, a business can be defined as a repeatable process that
1. creates or provides something of value
2. that people want or need
3. at a price they are willing to pay, 
4. in a way that satisfies the consumer's needs and expectations and
5. provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.

Every business is a collection of 5 processes each of which integrates smoothly with its next: Value Creation, Marketing, Sales, Value Delivery, Finance. These five are the building blocks of every idea and business plan, thus clearly defining them is crucial to understanding how the business works. We shall explore them step-by-step in greater detail.

## 1. Value Creation
Every business is limited by the size and quality of the market it aims at serving. If you don't have a large set of people who really want what you can offer, your chances of establishing a viable business are very slim (so-called *Iron Law of the Market*). Discover what people need or want and build it. However, not every business is economically valuable. Any skill or knowledge that helps create value, market, sell, deliver value, or manage finances is economically valuable. In total there are twelve standard forms of economic value:
* Product: Price a tanglible item at higher than its production costn (e.g. books)
* Service: Charge a fee for the benefit of help (e.g. barbershop)
* Shared Resource: Charge for access (e.g. gym, fitness clubs)
* Subscription: Charge a recurring fee (e.g. cable, satellite television)
* Resale: Resale an asset of the purchased bulk directly from a wholesaler to a retail buyer at higher price (e.g. Walmart, Barnes & Noble)
* Lease: Charge for the usage of an asset for a predefined amount of time (e.g. cars, boats, houses, DVD's)
* Agency: Charge a percentage of the transaction price for selling an asset on behalf of a third-party (e.g. literary agents, real estate)
* Audience Aggregation: Charge access fee for connecting an audience to a business (e.g. magazines with ad sites)
* Loan: Charge for lending money with an additional interest rate (e.g. mortgage, auto loans, credit cards)
* Option: Charge fee for taking action (e.g. movie or concert ticket, coupons, licensing rights)
* Insurance: Charge fee for taking on risk (e.g. car or health insurance, warranty cover for consumer goods)
* Capital: Collect a portion of the profit of ownership of a business (e.g. angel investing, venture capital, purchasing stock in publicly traded companies)

That said, all values are not treated equally. The value depends on the eye of the perceiver. In general, if you are looking for a business idea start looking for hassles. Where there is a hassle that is eliminable and has an attractive and easy-to-visualize end result there is a lucrative opportunity. Moreover, packaging individual forms together or unbundling them allows to customize value for different types of customers and give them exactly what they want without creating anything new (e.g. mobile phone with monthly service plan, songs in a music album).

At the outset of creation lies the prototype, the first attempt at creating something useful. Prototypes, or Minimum Viable Offers, give you a first understanding of your product and its value in the market. In each further iteration it should be clearly and quickly defined what one aims to achieve, thereby making best use of the obtained feedback. Virtually every improvement you make to an offer can be thought of in terms of nine economic values: either improving convenience (quick, reliable, easy, flexible, cost) or fidelity (efficacy, status, aesthetic appeal, emotional impact), both is rare. Thus, a choice must be made (so-called *trade-off*). To predict accurately this choice one can sell the offering (description, prototype, a few renderings) before it actually exists (example: FitBit), so-called *Shadow Testing*. If the idea is promising you're in a great position to make it happen! If not, you can still weather losses without losing money or reputation.

## 2. Marketing
You can create all the value in the world but if you do not manage to attract buyers you won't survive. In order to efficiently market a product it is recommended to use a form of message that directly appeals to a selected crowd that is already interested in your type of offers (remarkability, receptivity, addressability, desire). One should start by breaking the clients' state of preoccupation and divert their attention towards the product. Marketing is most effective when it focuses on the desired result, which should be a distinctive experience or emotion (e.g. going to Harvard will make one intelligent and powerful after graduation). One thing you can do is to screen customers to filter the bad ones before doing business together. Define your ideal customer and focus your efforts on serving him well. Attempting to attract the attention of people who don't care or require more risk than they are worth is a waste of time, energy and money. Moreover, by evaluating these parameters in advance you can reach out to a customer at the point when he enters the market and become the standard by which competing offers are measured.

Visualization is a technique that reinforces the "want" emotion. If you encourage your prospects to visualize what their life will look like with the product, you increase the probability that they'll purchase it from you. Additionally, emphasizing the details that are critically important while de-emphasizing things that aren't increases your persuasive power (so-called *framing*). Further, if you want to attract attention real paying customers quickly give out things for free, letting them experience the value you provide without obligation. Next, ask for their permission to follow up. Hooks (phrases that describe the offer's primary benefit) also help in grabbing attention. Call-To-Actions are another way to make sales: direct prospects to a particular action with a clear, simple and obvious proposal, such as visit a certain website, enter an e-mail address, call a phone number, click a button, etc. Testimonials, case studies and other stories showing customers the path to achieve what they want is another effective way of gaining attention. Healthy controversies invoke discussions and make people exchange viewpoints and opinions, thereby garnering more attention. Finally, your reputation influences your customer base and referrals. The greater it is the higher the chances of gaining new customers and continuing to do business with existing ones.

## 3. Sales
Without a minimum level of trust a transaction between two people will not happen. Building a trustworthy reputation over time by dealing fairly and honestly makes it easier to demonstrate trustworthiness and the higher your trustworthiness the greater the chances of a successful transaction.

A successful transaction is the essence of negotiation and negotiation is the process of exploring different options to find common ground. The more potential paths you explore and the more open you are the greater the chance you'll be able to find one in which your interests overlap. In Sales, the Pricing Uncertainty Principle applies: all prices are arbitrary and shapeable. So how does one go about setting a price that the customer will accept? There are 4 ways to proceed, where the first three can be used as baseline and the last one can be used to fix the optimal price.
1. Replacement cost: cost to create + desired margin
2. Market comparison: find similar offer
3. Discounted Cash Flow / Net Present Value: meant for business that generate ongoing cash flow
4. Value Comparison: estimate worth of unique characteristics (e.g. a house close to area school, Elvis Presley's house) to certain individuals

Keep in mind that prices are sensitive: as prices change the customers attracted to your offer will also change. The ideal value will then depend on your target market. A classic example of price sensitivity are automobiles - some cars are desirable exactly because they are expensive. In *value-based selling* salespeople focus on asking detailed questions to get to the root of what the prospect really wants. These questions increase the the confidence in their ability to deliver a solution as well as have them discover information to price appropriately. In *education-based selling* on the other hand, the prospects are made informed customers. By educating them you build trust in your expertise and make better customers who fully appreciate the product. In the case where no common ground can be found, it is beneficial to have alternatives. The more attractive they are and the better you know the prospects' alternatives the better deals you will close. Walk away from a bad deal!

Being generous helps enormously to improve sales. By giving away value and helping others you earn their respect, build a reputation but also make them more perceptive to your Call-To-Action. Barriers to sales include taking risks, high costs, doubts on the functionality or fit, lack of necessity, difficulty in usage. These can be tackled with a combination of educated-based and value-based selling, social comparisons, visualization, framing, full refunds and trials.

## 4. Value Delivery
Value Delivery involves everything that is required to make a customer happy, surpassing expectations when possible. This encompasses order processing, inventory manageent, delivery/fulfillment, troubleshooting and customer support. A successful business exceeds customer expectations and satisfies them even in a changing environment. Unsuccessful businesses fail to make their customers happy and lose them.

A value stream refers to all steps and processes from the start of the Value Creation up until delivery to the customer. Understanding value stream is important if you want to deliver value quickly, reliably and consistently. Tracing individual steps and transformations via diagrams streamlines the process. The shorter and more streamlined it is the easier it will be to manage and effectively deliver value. Distribution channels are a) direct-to-user distribution (e.g. haircut) and b) intermediary distribution across multiple channels (e.g. grocery store, supermarket).

Elements that can add to Value Delivery are 1) the Expectation Effect (surprises), 2) Predictability (uniformity - always the same, consistency, reliability). Besides, Duplication, Accumulation, Amplification and Automation (so-called *scale*) allow to distribute service across many paying customers at the same time. Products can be duplicated, whereas shared resources are easier to multiply. Services on the other hand, are difficult to scale since they rely on direct participation of people to deliver value.
