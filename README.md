# A Business Primer

Succinctly, a business can be defined as a repeatable process that
1. creates or provides something of value
2. that people want or need
3. at a price they are willing to pay, 
4. in a way that satisfies the consumer's needs and expectations and
5. provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.

Every business is a collection of 5 processes each of which integrates smoothly with its next: Value Creation, Marketing, Sales, Value Delivery, Finance. These five are the building blocks of every idea and business plan, thus clearly defining them is crucial to understanding how the business works. We shall explore them step-by-step.
